## DLL Setup
Go into VS 2019 and open ```Cloud.Runtime.sln```
<br>
Go to ```framework.h``` and edit the Host and Port to your needs.
<br>
Then build and place that in your launcher folder and continue with Backend Setup!

## Backend Setup
Read all of the Files in the Docs Folder inside the Backend to get started!
<br>
REMEMBER you may not host this for your own Dev/Server that is AGAINST OUR LICENCE only use for youself! DO NOT REHOST
<br>
Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
<br>
And install [DotNet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) click x64.
<br>
open the folder in command prompt and run ```npm install```
<br>
Run ```start.bat``` In the Backend and the Backend should now work!
<br>
For now you will have to find another launcher to use but as long as it injects a dll just rename ```Cloud.Runtime.dll``` to that dlls name and it will work!
